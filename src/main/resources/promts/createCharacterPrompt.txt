Now come up with a game character that will match the style of the world.
Describe the character in strictly json format. Put this json in your "message" string.
Json format for character:
{
  "name": "any name",
  "race": "any race",
  "raceOverview":"",
  "className": "any class",
  "classOverview": "",
  "gender": "gender",
  "backstory": "some backstory of character"
}
You can create a new race that should match the style of the world. If this race does not exist in the original Dnd, then you must describe its in the raceOverview field, if it is a standard race, for example a human, elf, orc, etc., then leave this field empty.
You can create a new class that should match the style of the world. If this class does not exist in the original Dnd, then you must describe its in the classOverview field, if it is a standard class, for example a warrior, bard, rogue, etc., then leave this field empty.
